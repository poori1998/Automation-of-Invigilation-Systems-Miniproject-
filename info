Abstract

The purpose of this project is to introduce and demonstrate an exam scheduling software system that performs efficient, accurate and robust solution searching to solve large and complex exam scheduling problems. The paper describes the main features of the system and how the efficient data model significantly improves search efficiency and interactivity when compared to the manual efforts and time utilized to develop the same project. 
The main system proposal is to simplify the existing system by automating the scheduling through parameters considered while prioritizing the posts of every individual staff belonging to each department.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

The problem consists on assigning a set of professors to a set of classes. Although it looks like a straightforward process, we must take into consideration that each professor has qualifications and also has a number of duties or “working hours” that indicate which/how many classes he/she will invigilate, respectively. Also, we have to deal with various other factors such as having senior professors, who should be given fewer no. of duties, squads, who are invigilators on the move and also special cases wherein a few or a specific faculty is unable to fulfil his/her duty for a specific day(s). 
1.3 OBJECTIVE
Project objectives are goals, plain and simple. These are the business objectives that you want the project to accomplish. Within project management, it is of utmost importance that a project's objectives are stated clearly as these will impact every decision in the project lifecycle. Project objectives must be measurable and contain key performance indicators that will be used to assess a project's success. These indicators will often encompass areas such as budget, quality, and time to completion. 
Objectives
•	To automate the task of assigning a faculty member to a class 
•	Managing the various ratios of duties calculated in accordance to department strengths,designation and duties
•	To dynamically generate these ratios based on the inputs varying from one exam season to another thereby making it very flexible and reusable
•	To ensure that no clash between the any two or more duties or two or more kinds of duties happens.
•	To see to it that all faculty receive their fair share of duties so as to avoid any kind of conflict between faculty members. 
•	To ensure that no class is left without an invigilator 
•	To see that the software is customizable due to occurrence of special conditions such as the absence of a faculty member.
